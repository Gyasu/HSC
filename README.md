# HSC â€” Human Site Constraint

**HSC** (Human Site Constraint) is a computational framework for estimating evolutionary constraint scores at amino acid resolution based on human genetic variation data.  
These scores quantify the depletion of observed missense variants relative to expected variation, providing insight into functional and evolutionary constraints on protein sites.
